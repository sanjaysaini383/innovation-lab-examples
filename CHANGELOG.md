# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `mcp-agents/gmail_chat_uagent`: block prompt-injection tool abuse — Gmail MCP tools must match an allowlist in `_run_gmail_tool`; regex parsing of `tool_calls` from assistant plain text is disabled by default (`GMAIL_CHAT_PARSE_TEXT_TOOLS` opt-in for dev only)

### Added
- `security-scanner-agent/`: LLM-powered code security analysis agent that scans code snippets via ASI:One and returns structured vulnerability reports (type, severity, line number, description, suggested fix). Built on a multi-agent Bureau using the standard Agent Chat Protocol; ASI:One-compatible and discoverable on Agentverse.
- `ticketlens-agent/`: Live real-time travel discovery AI agent powered by TicketLens MCP. High-precision reasoning utilizing the ASI1 LLM, persistent `uAgents` storage, and directly actionable booking deep links.
- `openclaw/`: OpenClaw examples — `fetchai-openclaw-orchestrator` (connector + orchestrator, repo health analyzer) and `agentverse-caller` (OpenClaw skill to search and message Agentverse agents)
- `stripe-payment-agents/youtube-growth-analyzer-agent`: Multi-agent YouTube channel analyzer with free preview and Stripe-gated premium report flow, built for Agentverse/ASI:One chat + payment protocols
- `openai-agent-sdk/Appliance Auto Whisperer`: Multi-agent right-to-repair system — Gemini Vision (via OpenAI SDK) identifies broken parts from photos, Bright Data scrapes prices from 6+ retailers, YouTube Data API finds repair tutorials. Orchestrator coordinates workers via REST fan-out with Docker Compose support.

- `openai-agent-sdk/Appliance Auto Whisperer`: Multi-agent right-to-repair assistant for ASI:One with orchestrator + parts/tutorial workers, streamlined bureau-first architecture, and updated README demo screenshots

- `google-adk/google-trends-agent`: Fetch.ai uAgent that answers natural-language Google Trends questions with per-query Stripe payment gating, using ASI:One LLM for BigQuery SQL generation and result interpretation

- `stripe-payment-agents/conversational-property-finder`: ASI1 conversational property search agent (Repliers MLS, optional Stripe details paywall, OpenAI/regex parsing)
- `ag2-agents/` — Two AG2 (formerly AutoGen) multi-agent examples: a payment approval workflow and a research synthesis team, both integrated with uAgents via the A2A protocol
- `community_agent/` — AI Community Growth Agent for planning events, conferences, and hackathons
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with agent-focused contribution workflow and merge policy
- Pull request CI workflow with checks for `stargazer-gate`, `lint`, `format`, `typecheck`, `validate-architecture`, and `test`
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` for required reviewer routing
- `ISSUES_GUIDE.md` and issue templates for bug/error/path/code/feature reports
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` for structured PR submissions
- `docs/AGENT_README_TEMPLATE.md` for contributor-ready agent README format
