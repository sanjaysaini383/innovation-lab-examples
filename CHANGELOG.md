## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `stripe-payment-agents/twitch-growth-agent/`: Twitch channel growth copilot built on the Fetch.ai uAgents framework. Integrates ASI:One LLM (intent classification, LangGraph 5-node growth pipeline, announcement drafting), Stripe embedded checkout (in-chat one-time unlock), Twitch Helix API (chat settings, announcements, raids, clips), and EventSub WebSocket (reactive copilot that monitors live stream events and proactively suggests actions).

- `Browser-based-agents/playwright/job-application-agent/`: Playwright + ASI:One + Stripe job application agent. Orchestrates a Chromium session to auto-fill Greenhouse application forms using a stored user profile, with LLM-drafted free-text answers via ASI:One, Stripe-gated premium features, and resume ingestion.
- GSSoC '26 label system: [.github/labels/gssoc-labels.json](.github/labels/gssoc-labels.json) definitions, [.github/scripts/create-gssoc-labels.sh](.github/scripts/create-gssoc-labels.sh) bootstrap script, `gssoc-label-bootstrap` workflow (auto-create/update labels), `gssoc-label-sync` workflow (copy `gssoc26`/`level1-3` labels from linked issues to PRs for dashboard tracking), and [docs/GSSOC.md](docs/GSSOC.md) guide
- `langchain-agents/deep-agents/hackflow-agent/`: LangChain Deep Agents hackathon intelligence agent for ASI:One. Three-subagent research pipeline (event_finder, sponsor_researcher, winner_researcher), Stripe-gated full analysis, ASI:One primary LLM with fallbacks, Tavily web search, and persisted cross-turn follow-up memory.
- `news-card-agent/`: ASI:One interactive-cards example. Live news rendered as a `card_kind: "custom"` element-tree (section → list of items with image, heading, text, badge, and a "Read Full Article" button). Tapping a button opens a fresh detail card. Multi-backend news cascade (Tavily → NewsAPI.org → Hacker News), ASI1 LLM-polished card copy, and no payment protocol.
- Auto badge workflow [award-contributor-badge.yml](.github/workflows/award-contributor-badge.yml) for merged external contributor PRs; [BADGE_REGISTRY.json](contributors/BADGE_REGISTRY.json) and [profile-badge-sync](contributors/profile-badge-sync/) for GitHub Profile README
- Maintainer bypass for `review-required` and `stargazer-gate` (Fetch.ai org, repo write access, [.github/MAINTAINERS](.github/MAINTAINERS))
- GitHub issues #54–#91 for intermediate bugs, docs, and `ai-agent-idea` challenges
- `contributors/` folder with [contributors/README.md](contributors/README.md) guide and [contributors/CHANGELOG.md](contributors/CHANGELOG.md) for community agent submissions

- Issue templates: contributor good-first tasks and real-time agent challenge
- `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` maintainer setup for required reviews and status checks
- `security-scanner-agent/`: LLM-powered code security analysis agent that scans code snippets via ASI:One and returns structured vulnerability reports (type, severity, line number, description, suggested fix). Built on a multi-agent Bureau using the standard Agent Chat Protocol; ASI:One-compatible and discoverable on Agentverse.
- `ticketlens-agent/`: Live real-time travel discovery AI agent powered by TicketLens MCP. High-precision reasoning utilizing the ASI1 LLM, persistent `uAgents` storage, and directly actionable booking deep links.

- `stripe-payment-agents/youtube-growth-analyzer-agent`: Multi-agent YouTube channel analyzer with free preview and Stripe-gated premium report flow, built for Agentverse/ASI:One chat + payment protocols
- `openai-agent-sdk/Appliance Auto Whisperer`: Multi-agent right-to-repair system — Gemini Vision (via OpenAI SDK) identifies broken parts from photos, Bright Data scrapes prices from 6+ retailers, YouTube Data API finds repair tutorials. Orchestrator coordinates workers via REST fan-out with Docker Compose support.
- `openai-agent-sdk/Appliance Auto Whisperer`: Multi-agent right-to-repair assistant for ASI:One with orchestrator + parts/tutorial workers, streamlined bureau-first architecture, and updated README demo screenshots
